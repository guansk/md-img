00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 So what you're about to watch may be the most comprehensive Amazon FBA keyword strategy you've ever seen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 This stuff is honestly so powerful, it's going to put you in the top 1% of Amazon sellers,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.600
 because frankly no tool or strategy does what we're going to uncover in this video.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 What we're going to do is harness keyword data from seven different sources,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.900
 including leading software like Helium 10, never before integrated software Zonguru,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.199
 which I know my Aussie sellers are going to love, KeywordTool.io, Amazon Opportunity Explorer,

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:40.700
 Amazon Brand Analytics, Amazon PaperClick Reports, and yes, even Amazon Search Query Report.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.400
 If you came here looking for a normal Amazon FBA video, this is no,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.599
 because this is Keyword Masterclass Re-Promo.

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:54.800
 Hey guys, what is up? This is Heist.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 And if you came here looking for Amazon FBA deep dive strategic content,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 you came to the right place because every single Monday we drop a video on just that topic.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 But I got to say this one is absolutely special.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.100
 Running back the clock about two years ago, the most popular video on this channel with north of 60,000 views

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.000
 was my Keyword Masterclass video.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 And as groundbreaking as that was, about a year later, we came out with Keyword Masterclass 2.0,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.900
 which automated a lot of those keyword strategies using a special Google Sheets tool called Keyword Dominator.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.200
 But if you thought the dust had settled, if you thought that was it, you were wrong.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 Because today I'm going to break down new strategies, new data integrations,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 and new mind boggling elite level strategies leveraging an updated tool, Keyword Dominator Boosted.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.800
 Now this video is going to be technical.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.400
 This video is going to be advanced.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.100
 This video is going to be in depth.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 But I'm telling you, if you stay through to the end, if you follow these steps,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.199
 if you integrate these strategies in your Amazon business, in your Amazon listings, into your operating strategy,

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:04.399
 you will have a competitive advantage unlike anything else in the space.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.899
 So go full window on this.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 Pay attention. Take notes.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.299
 Buckle yourself in because it's going to be a pre-wild ride.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.200
 All right. So welcome to Keyword Dominator Boosted.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.600
 What we're going to do here is just go through really quickly how to set it up.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.500
 There's going to be a nine step process that we're going to go through.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 Should take you about 10 minutes in most cases.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.900
 And then as you run new refreshes over time, it will literally take minutes, under a minute potentially.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.299
 And really importantly, we're going to talk through also some of the strategies you can harness

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.700
 with this data aggregation that can really take your keyword game to the next level.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.000
 If you want Keyword Dominator Boosted, I've got a link down below that will give you access to some resources in this video,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.600
 as well as a special link to actually sign up.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.700
 For a limited time, it's going to be $19 a month.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.100
 That could change. So if you're watching this like a year from now, don't shoot me.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.400
 And this is a separate and unique tool.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.299
 So if you sign up for the free Keyword Dominator when it first came out or the pro version,

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.500
 those are still active. You can still use those.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.200
 This is an additional tool that you need to sign up for.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.600
 And I should note, I don't get anything from this in terms of affiliate commissions, stuff like that.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.700
 I've just worked really closely and got a good friendship with Brett that's built these tools over the last couple of years

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.600
 and locked arms with me and really built out a lot of my ideas and his own ideas into really usable, scalable tools.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 So all this stuff goes to him. It's literally a one man team with like a contractor uses.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.500
 So please sign up if you think this is valuable. It's going to a good place.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 All right. So before we get into the nine step setup process,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.899
 there's some quick onboarding stuff that you need to do one time.

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:37.000
 Basically, after you've signed up, you need to use your FBA Excel login, email your password, set the country you're in.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
 I recommend that you download a data scraper that we're going to use in some of the steps.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.799
 You can throw in your Helium 10 account ID if that's one of the tools that you're using here.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.600
 So if you're using Helium 10, it's really easy to link that account.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.299
 You just go log in to Helium 10, copy this number beside the account ID equals.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.899
 That's what you're going to throw in here.

00:03:54.899 --> 00:04:00.000
 You can set up a separate Google Drive account if you want to have this as a completely independent account,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.399
 or you can actually link it to an existing Google account.

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.700
 Either way works.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.299
 And then all you need to do after you've done all those setup steps is just hit authorize here.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.400
 Once you do that, it's going to have this pop-up authorization required, just hit continue on that.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.800
 And then it's going to have you choose an account that you want to use for your Google or Gmail.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.000
 You then have to go here to advanced, then just go to keyword dominator unsafe and hit allow.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300
 And then you just hit this authorize button again one more time.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 It's going to run a quick script, which is going to pull up all of the menus that we're going to dive into in this demo.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.000
 And once that is done, you're going to now have this keyword dominator boosted drop-down.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.500
 We're going to work a lot in that.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.300
 The other thing that's going to do, it's going to populate within your Google Drive,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.000
 you have a new folder called FBA Excel tools keyword dominator.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 And then this is actually going to be one of the sources where we're going to dump some of these files.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.500
 So now we're off to the races.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.800
 Let's get down to business.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 So after you follow the onboarding, the next step is to come down here to this new research section.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.100
 Just enter the main keyword for the product that you're actually evaluating or a core search term for your actual product.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 So in this example, we're going to assume that we actually have a golf travel case and we run it.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.700
 And we want to run this through keyword dominator boosted.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.599
 So you just type in golf travel case there, come down to keyword dominator boosted, this new research section,

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.099
 go search on Amazon and get the top 10 ASINs.

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.400
 It's going to run a script, which is going to then populate and open up Amazon right here.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.000
 So you now have the search results.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.599
 Now you can either come through here on the search results and manually copy these ASINs here,

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.099
 or you could just come through here to Cerebro, go to X-Ray if you're using Helium 10,

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.000
 or if you're using Zonguru, you can open up their Chrome extension.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.400
 And you can come through here and identify your ASIN, if this is your product.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.000
 In addition to nine other ones, or if you're doing research for the first time and you don't have an actual product,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.500
 just find 10 of the ASINs that are the most successful in terms of revenue performance

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.799
 and that are most like and most relevant to your brand that you're actually going to compete against.

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:52.200
 So we're going to pretend here that this Outdoor Master padded golf bag is actually our travel case.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.400
 Come in here and that's going to be my ASIN.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.200
 And then again, we'll just come through there one by one and add the ones that are most successful.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.700
 So now I've got that all populated.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700
 I'm good to go.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.500
 Again, if you are a Zonguru user and other really cool software similar to Helium 10

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500
 that I know a lot of my Aussie friends use,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.400
 you can just come down to this drop down menu here and select Zonguru,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.300
 and then it will default to Zonguru settings.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.300
 So I'm going to use Helium 10 as an example here.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.099
 But anytime if you're using Zonguru, you can flip over and do that.

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.500
 So now we've got everything set up.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.700
 Next, what you're going to want to do is actually sign in to all the data sources that we're going to use.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.099
 So sign in to your Helium 10 or Zonguru account.

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.800
 Sign in to your Amazon Seller Central account.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800
 Because it's going to actually populate and open up all of the windows that we need to actually download some of the source data.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.300
 So what we're going to do then is we're going to come down to keyword dominator,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.000
 come down here to to download new data.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.200
 It's going to run a quick script and then it's going to open a whack load of tabs that we're going to pull all of the data from.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.400
 So now let's go to these tabs.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.800
 What we now want to do is from all these different data sources,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.800
 we're going to download some source files,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.900
 upload them to our Google Drive folder.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.600
 And then that's where the magic is going to happen.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.500
 So we'll go through these one by one and cover all the steps here.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.800
 So the first one we're going to do is Helium 10 X-Ray.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.000
 So it's opened up the amazon.com search query for us.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.300
 Just come here to the Chrome extension, go to X-Ray.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.200
 And then we just go ahead and download that CSV report.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.100
 Now each of these files we're going to rename so that the script can actually work here.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.200
 So in the case of X-Ray, it's going to be file name XR.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 It's going to download that.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.000
 And how you can actually see the names that you need to use here is all of the data sources here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.700
 It's going to tell you the actual name that you need to import.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.200
 Then it's going to tell you where in that Google Drive you actually need to import those files.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.800
 So we've got XR here.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.099
 So what we would do is come back to our Drive, Google Drive here.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:37.099
 And then we just copy this XR into Helium 10 and we're off to the races.

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.000
 The next thing that we need to import is all this Amazon data.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.099
 And I think one of the cool things about this tool is it's not using external data,

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:45.599
 external scrapes, estimates.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.900
 This is real world Amazon data from disparate sources that really matters.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.000
 Unfortunately though, Amazon being Amazon,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.600
 not all of them are downloadable via CSV or text files.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.400
 So that's why we download that data scraper so that we can scrape some of the data off of our Amazon account

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.600
 that matters to really build out these keyword lists.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.100
 So first we're going to start with the Opportunity Explorer.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.900
 What we want to do here first is come to this items per page and go to 100,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.600
 just so it expands that.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.100
 Then you just click anywhere here on this table.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.500
 You go to the HTML table scraper here that we downloaded.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.400
 Then we're going to copy table to file.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.500
 And again, we got to name this appropriately.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.100
 So if I look over here, it's going to be OE for the Opportunity Explorer.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.000
 Hit OK.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.900
 Save that.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.700
 That's downloaded.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.200
 I then come back here and I'd upload that to my Amazon folder because this is an Amazon one.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200
 So we've got the Opportunity Explorer data.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.500
 Let's go to brand analytics.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.700
 So for brand analytics, what we want to do is basically paste any and all ASINs on the front page into here.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.800
 It's going to reverse engineer all those ASINs to see where they're the top one, two or third clicked product

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.400
 across a bunch of different keywords.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.600
 And it's going to uncover some unique ones for us.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.300
 So how we get those ASINs is just coming back here to this Amazon results.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.100
 And I would basically just select all of these suckers here and download that CSV report again, the x-ray file.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.000
 And then I would just open up a new Google sheet and then I'm going to import, go to upload.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.500
 I'm just going to drag that sucker in there, replace spreadsheet, hit go.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
 And then all I'm going to do here is just grab all these ASINs right here.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.400
 Copy that.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.699
 Come back to brand analytics.

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.300
 I'm going to enter those ASINs here.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.500
 You can choose the report time window, whether it's weekly, monthly, etc.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.700
 I'm just going to do weekly here.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.400
 It's going to pull the most previous week.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.000
 Then you just save that file as BA for brand analytics.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.800
 Drag that into the Amazon one.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.100
 Go over to the next one here.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.000
 Now this one's really cool.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.500
 This is a pretty recent addition here.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.300
 The last six months or so from Amazon, which is the search query performance report.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300
 Again, very similar to the opportunity to explore.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.500
 The thing that sucks is you can't download it.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.000
 So what we're going to do here is data scrape this.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.200
 We're going to come down here and go to view 100 rows.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.400
 It's going to clean it up a little bit.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.200
 This one's a little bit of a pain in the butt, but you only have to really do it once every quarter,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.100
 every six months.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.200
 I think you can get away with it.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.300
 So it takes a little bit of time.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.700
 But what we're going to do here is click the table scraper again, go to copy to file.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.600
 And if I come back over here to some of these data sources, if I look at the search query report,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.800
 you'll see it says SQ1 to SQ10.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.500
 Because there's a hundred results per tab, we're going to basically save 10 of these different files.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.100
 So this first one here, I'm just going to call SQ1, save that sucker.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.500
 I'm going to drag that into the Amazon.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.700
 I'm going to do that 10 times.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.300
 So I get all of the search query performance data.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.700
 And then the final thing that we're going to do,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.100
 this is only really necessary if this is an existing product of yours that you're looking at,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.600
 is we actually want to download all the pay-per-click oriented data,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.900
 which we can then look at the keywords and see how our pay-per-click performance is across different keywords.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.100
 There's really three reports we're going to download here.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.000
 I'm not going to go through that in detail because it's relatively easy to set up.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.100
 But basically, you're going to come up here to create report.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.200
 And then we're going to basically do the search term report.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.400
 We're going to do the search term impression share.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.300
 And then we're going to do the advertised product.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.600
 So there's three of those reports, download them, use the appropriate name.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.700
 When you save the file.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.800
 And then once again, you upload those to the Google Drive.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.100
 Now the next one, and this is a new addition, which is a really, really cool tool.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.900
 It's called keywordtool.io.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.800
 If you come here to the Amazon one, which is going to be pre-populated in your tabs,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 what you basically do is type in any keyword.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.700
 In this case, we're going to use our masthead golf travel case.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:11.500
 And then what it does is it reverse engineers as though you were typing in that keyword as a human being into the Amazon search bar.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.500
 And it finds all of Amazon's suggested words that come up for that.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.900
 So for this and in the free version, you don't need to worry about all this additional data.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.200
 We just come here to HTML table scraper again.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.200
 We're going to copy that one to clipboard this time.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.500
 Come back to keyword boosted.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.500
 We're actually going to go to this key tab here.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.600
 And you'll notice there's a custom list section.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.900
 We'll get into the details of this here later on.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.300
 And then all we do is paste in there.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.900
 Now we've got all these additional keywords that will be a new data source for us.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.600
 So there's only a few more here that it's going to do.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.200
 It's going to open up scribbles tabs in Helium 10 if you've got that selected.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.600
 Or it's going to do the Zonguru listing optimizer.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.900
 If that's your software of choice.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.400
 So there's going to be a different tab for each one of those ASINs that you've selected.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.000
 What we're going to do there is just go ahead and export this.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.500
 Copy to CSV.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.600
 And then all we basically need to do when we save this is just save it as one underscore ASIN one,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.100
 two, et cetera, depending on which ASIN it is.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.900
 So if you come here to scribbles, go to download, export as CSV.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.400
 Just going to name that as one ASIN one.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.900
 Save it.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.700
 Because this is Helium 10 source data, throw that in the Helium 10 folder.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.400
 And you're going to want to pull in scribbles data for your ASIN for sure if this is one of your products.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.199
 Or if there's some key competitors you want to analyze and look at their listing details

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.100
 on what they have in the title, bullets, et cetera.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.900
 That's where you're going to want to pull those text files.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.000
 And then the final data source here is going to be Cerebro, the world famous Cerebro.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.400
 So it's going to open up and populate here on all of this.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.100
 We're going to go ahead and hit get keywords.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.699
 And then just use the minimum search form.

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:32.500
 I usually go three to 500.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.500
 In this case, let's kind of keep it at 500.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.400
 Any of these other filters that you want to run, you can absolutely run those there.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.199
 You can apply the filter here.

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:42.000
 Then you just come down here to export data.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.300
 Save as a CSV.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.400
 And this is going to be CR is the one that we're going to save that as.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.599
 Download, pop that sucker here and helium 10 because that's the source and we are good to go.

00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:54.199
 So we've now uploaded all the different data sources.

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:57.500
 Again, as a one time thing, it takes whatever, eight to 10 minutes.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.599
 But in the future, if you want to come back and run this every day, every week, every month,

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:04.699
 you only need to repopulate the data that you want to see refreshed.

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:07.099
 So maybe you just want to rerun Cerebro once a month.

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:10.000
 You just come in here and all you need to do is upload a CR file.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 And then you rerun this whole thing and you're good to go.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.500
 Once all those data sources are aggregated, we're then going to kind of have some fun here.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.300
 So we're going to go ahead and hit import data into keyword dominator and voila.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.800
 It'll say new data sync complete hit okay.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.500
 And then you can basically see here all of these different import statuses.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.600
 It'll show now uploaded all these different ones that you uploaded.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.300
 Now let's say that you didn't want to do some of these search query reports.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.500
 You didn't want to do any of the advertising reports from Amazon.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.800
 You know, you're using Zonguru data as well.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.900
 You can basically toggle all of these so it'll only scrape the sources that you want.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.099
 So you don't need to do all of those different versions.

00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:48.699
 I just wanted to show all the different data sources so you can see what the possibility is.

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:51.800
 But you can literally just run this with Helium 10 Cerebro if you want

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.900
 and have that as the only file that you import.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.900
 So now that we've got this, we can start building and cross referencing all this data into a target keyword list.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.300
 So if I come down here to keyword dominator, build target list,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.099
 because I'm using Helium 10 here, I'll go ahead and add Cerebro keywords.

00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:08.500
 It's going to run another script.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.600
 So now that all the data is in there, if I come to this key tab and open up any of these things,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.100
 we can see all of the Cerebro data that came out of Helium 10.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.400
 If I want to come here to brand analytics, it's got all the brand analytics data.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.500
 If I want to look at the search query report, it's now got all of this.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.800
 So you can look at the raw data imported here.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.300
 Don't worry, it's not going to be this messy.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.700
 It's actually going to aggregate all this stuff into a much cleaner format.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.800
 But the other thing that we can do here if we want to change how this actually is scraping data

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.500
 before we import it into a target keyword list, we can do that here.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.300
 So what this is basically saying is that we want to find at least keywords that are in the top 30.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.800
 So they're the first page.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.100
 We want at least three of these competitive ASINs out of 10 to actually be ranked for it.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:55.000
 And then the alpha threshold is basically going to take any of the alpha ASINs that we select as toggles up here.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.800
 And it's going to pull any keywords where they've got a top 10 keyword ranking,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.600
 which is really important because some of these alpha ASINs will rank on keywords that almost nobody else has.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600
 And we want to identify what those words are.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.400
 So if you ever want to play with any of that criteria for Helium 10 data, you can do it right there.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.000
 So if we come back here to this tab, if we go to keyword boosted, we now want to build a target list.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.300
 So depending on whether you use Zonguru or Helium 10, you can kind of select either or or both.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.200
 But we used Helium 10, so we're going to go ahead and add Cerebro keywords.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.900
 It's going to run a little script here for us.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.300
 And then it's imported the keywords.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.800
 So this is where the fun happens.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.200
 If we come to the wizard tab here, this is where a lot of the data is going to show up that really matters.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.400
 So first things first, the first ASIN that you put in there,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.200
 whether it's yours or if you're doing product research and it's one of the top performing ones,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.100
 it's going to pull in all of their listing content.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.700
 That's why we did the scribbles upload.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.200
 So it's got the title bullets, all that stuff there.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.300
 And then any other ones that you've selected in the tab, it's also going to show those here as well.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.200
 So if you only want to see a handful of these, you can kind of deselect some of them.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.500
 So you're only looking at the listings that you want to compare against the most.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500
 It's going to have your star rating.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.100
 It's going to have your revenue per month.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.400
 It's going to have your order volume on a monthly basis as well.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.400
 So it's got some additional data that it's pulled in.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.200
 But here's some other really cool data.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.000
 So for each one of these listings here, and this one is my listing, as you can see here,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.100
 you can see the total search volume that any keyword that they've indexed on is going to show in here.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.100
 Anywhere where they're ranked top 10, it's going to show the total search volume here.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.600
 Anywhere the top 30, it's going to show the total percentage of that here.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.300
 Then it even breaks down into where those search volumes exist within the listing.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.199
 So is it in the title?

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:34.900
 Is it exact search volume?

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.099
 Or are they using some permutations like broader phrase to pick up those keywords?

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:43.400
 So a lot of interesting data rich stuff that's going to show all the different ASINs

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.800
 and where the ranking and indexing is coming from.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.900
 It's got all the additional data here on what category it's in, what the price is, et cetera.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.099
 And then here's what's really, really interesting is it's going to show how many search terms

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.500
 each of these ASINs are ranked for in different spreads.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.400
 So in this example of our product, we've got 14 keywords where we're ranked one to four,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.700
 and there's 22,601 searches per month that that picks up.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.700
 We're between spots five and 10 with 15 keywords and 77 search volume, et cetera.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:19.300
 You can even change these distributions down here if you wanted to have different spreads and do that customize.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.500
 But this gives you a really good idea on hey, where are we ranked and where we're really ranked in the upper tier?

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.400
 How many words is it?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.500
 And what's the associated search volume?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.700
 This is really, really powerful diagnostic stuff.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.000
 And it's really powerful for looking at other ASINs here as well.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.700
 And then what it's got here is it's pulled in all of the Cerebro data here.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.700
 So we can see all of those score of three or higher.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.600
 It's got every single search volume here.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.000
 But what's really cool is is the search volume column here.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.700
 If we've got actual Amazon data, which is why we pulled in those reports,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.100
 it's going to override what any of the software companies have estimated.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.700
 Because a lot of them could be wildly off.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.900
 So wherever possible, we want to pull in real data from Amazon.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.500
 And this will override that data where possible with real Amazon data.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.100
 And you can see here basically how it's going to determine which search volume to use.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.500
 So it's going to start with the search query report.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.200
 Then it's going to use Cerebro or it's going to use Zonguru.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.200
 And you can even change the criteria here if you wanted it to use Helium 10 data.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.600
 First, you could totally do that.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.200
 But it's going to default to actually scraping and using Amazon data.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.000
 And then it's going to give a bunch of different things here.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.300
 So each of the ASINs again, it's going to give the organic rank performance

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.300
 where they're top 10 or top 30 for that particular word.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.500
 If we scroll on over here and you've got actual pay-per-click data for your own product,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.500
 it's going to show your search term impression rank, your search term impression share, conversion rate,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.600
 click spend, sales orders, click through rate, et cetera,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.200
 for the period that you selected where you downloaded your report.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.399
 It's got the search term query report, which is super, super, super powerful.

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:49.300
 It's going to show you all this stuff here in terms of impressions, clicks, add to cart orders,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.800
 really rich data that you haven't seen anywhere else.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.200
 And being able to look at it at the keyword level is super powerful as you prioritize things.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.500
 And then it's also going to brand analytics information.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.300
 So if there's a search frequency rank number, it's going to pin that.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.800
 And then if a particular ASIN has a conversion or click share for a particular keyword,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.600
 you'll be able to see that here as well.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.800
 So that's pretty badass unto itself, but there's some additional stuff that we can do to beef this list up.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.700
 If we want, we could come here to the keyword dominator boosted, build target list.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.300
 We could come here to add alpha ASINs.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.600
 So again, those toggles that we selected in this case of Cerebro, we picked four ASINs.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.400
 It's going to pull any term where they're top 10 at all.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.800
 And if those don't exist on this current target list, it's going to add them.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.500
 So you can go ahead and add the alpha ASINs.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.800
 It's going to run a quick script.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.300
 Just hit yes here.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.900
 I'm just going to say the keywords are imported.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.500
 We're good to go.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.100
 Hit OK.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.200
 Then if I come up over here, we can see here's an example of an alpha ASIN, one that was imported, the Stitch Golf Bag.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.800
 You can see the source of the data here being that ASIN there.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.300
 Now, the other thing you can do is to add some manual words.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:52.600
 So if we come here to the source data tab in the key tab and let's use as an example, the brand analytics.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.199
 So basically this green here shows that it's already been imported into our target list.

00:19:57.199 --> 00:20:03.199
 But you can see here there's a whack load of stuff that came from Amazon's brand analytics data keywords that we may care about,

00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:06.399
 that we may want to import into our target list as well.

00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:12.000
 So whether you wanted to sort these by color or just come in here manually and look at the words that you think makes sense to add,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.199
 I'll just go ahead and add four there.

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:14.699
 You can totally do that.

00:20:14.699 --> 00:20:17.300
 The other thing is with the opportunity explorer, same kind of deal.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.300
 It looks like everything that came out of opportunity explorer, we've already gotten our target list because it's highlighted green.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:29.300
 But if you come to the search query report, we can also see some of these ones that are not in green that we may want to add like golf bag for airplane.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.000
 Yeah, that sounds like a term that we want to have.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.300
 Art-studded golf travel bag.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:32.700
 Sure.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.000
 So any of these that you want to add manually in addition to this custom list that we pulled in from that keyword tool,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.500
 it's going to give us additional keyword targets that really don't exist and that most sellers are never going to uncover.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.300
 So after we've done that, we basically just come here to build target lists.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.399
 We'll add the manual words.

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:50.399
 It's going to pull all those additional words into our target list.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.500
 So it says the keywords are imported, hit OK.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.600
 And then we basically come here.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.300
 And now we've got a super healthy list here that we can really start playing with and strategizing with.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.100
 We can literally rerun this anytime if we've got new files that we want to upload.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.100
 All we need to do is download those new files, put them in the Google Drive,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.200
 and we can update this daily, weekly, monthly, whenever we want and have a source document in Google Sheets,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.800
 which is super easy to edit as our keyword repository of choice.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.000
 So let's get into the strategy.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.900
 This is the fun stuff.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.800
 Setup's not fun.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.500
 I totally get it.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.400
 But once we've got the stuff set up, it's really easy to use.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.300
 Let's talk about the power of how we can leverage this data now.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.100
 Now, the first and probably most important one is that you can actually prioritize this list or your ace

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.600
 and to uncover and understand the words that have the most power from a keyword standpoint

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.200
 and the words that we really want to prioritize from a relevancy standpoint.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.900
 So let's say as an example, we wanted to take this target list here and we wanted to sort.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.100
 We want to remove anything that has no search volume and then sort by highest to lowest.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.500
 We can then come through here and assign a priority.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.400
 So because this is golf club set for men, that's probably not a high priority because this is a golf bag.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.200
 Although we may want to target, we may want to put that as a three, like a lower priority.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 But this golf travel bags for airlines with wheels, heck yeah, that's our product.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.800
 It's a one.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.600
 Golf bag travel case, it's a one.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 You get the idea, but you can sort here by search volume, which are all relevant words

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.500
 and basically identify the keywords that you want to optimize.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.100
 And we can see over here on the left that this is not in the title search terms bullet description or A plus content.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.100
 So I could come up here and as an example, just throw this in here and put golf bag travel case.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.699
 And you can see it got highlighted there.

00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:24.000
 So it gives us real time ability to see where we're optimized for keywords, where we're not.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.899
 We can scroll across here and see our organic rank versus other competitors that we've selected.

00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:34.500
 You can see all of this keyword research data from software, from pay-per-click and Amazon data here as well.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.800
 So prioritization is probably one of the biggest things that you can do with this list.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.800
 And you're bringing in keywords again and source data that no one else is using.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.100
 Let's say that you wanted to kind of flag some words that have branded terms.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.700
 So like Sunday bag is actually a brand.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:54.200
 So I could come in here and put Sunday bag and remove it from the list or any of like spalding, you know, title list, whatever it is.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.300
 And it's actually going to flag a warning sign here.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.399
 So if you have any warning words that you want to put in here that you don't actually want to optimize for,

00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:01.899
 you can put it in that remove list.

00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:07.399
 Or let's say that you've got a product that's plastic and you want to remove anything that has wood just because it's not relevant.

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:09.500
 You could put wood in there and it's going to flag this here.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.399
 So you can also use this for relevancy sorts.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.600
 Second key strategy that we can leverage this for is to understand keyword distribution.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.000
 So if I come up here, the keyword dominator boosted and I go check keyword distribution on the listing wizard tool.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.300
 It's going to run a script here and then it's going to look at your listing or that first one that you put in.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.400
 And it's going to look at how many times you've got different words.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.200
 So in this case, we've got golf 107 times and it counts for a search volume of 123,000.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.100
 It goes from top to bottom here based on the count.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.600
 So you can just see how many times the words are showing up.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:45.199
 This is really good so we can start to see those source keywords that can be really powerful ranking across a bunch of different terms on Amazon.

00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:49.000
 The third strategy we can use this for us to identify high potential keywords.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And this is really unique to this tool and fricking badass.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.100
 And we've been using this in my business so we can identify unique keywords that we want to rank for,

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.000
 that we want to improve or that we want to steal from competitors.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.199
 So if you come back here to the settings tab, you can basically see the filtering criteria, which you can customize.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.800
 But what this is basically saying for the high potential list to start is when my organic rank is between positions 15 and 50,

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.000
 means I'm close, right?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 I'm like either on the fringe of page one or I'm on the lower mid end.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.200
 And I might have the potential to bump that into the top quarter of SERP and really gain a lot more value.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:28.000
 So if I come here to this drop down here and I go to the high potential list and run that script, it's going to run the high potential filter.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.400
 All it's done here is it's taken every keyword from that target list and it's only found the ones where we're positioned 15 to 50.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.600
 So it's customized this.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:44.100
 So what's really cool about this is I could select all these terms here and I can copy those terms and set up a custom paper click campaign if I want to bump them.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.000
 Or let's say I wanted to run Google ads on those keywords to see if external traffic can drive up a rank.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 I've now got a custom list of keywords.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.400
 You can also download that here, which will download all of the files to your Google Drive.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.100
 So if you just want to download this as a Google Sheets doc, they can do that as well.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.800
 The other cool target here in addition to high potential is competitive winners.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:10.700
 So the criteria that we set up on this one here as a default is the competitors ranked less than 15 and my rank is above position 15.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.600
 I want to know about it.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.700
 This is basically saying find all the words where my competitors are doing really well and where I'm slipping.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:22.600
 And I may want to identify those words, see if I can actually bring them up and find those keywords that my competitors are ranking for that I'm not.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.800
 Again, you can run custom paper click on those.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800
 You can run Google ads.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.700
 You can do a bunch of different things with optimization in your listing, change your title around to be able to target those.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.899
 So if I wanted to run that, it's the same kind of deal here.

00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:34.100
 I would basically just come in.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.500
 I would do competitor winners.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.200
 It's going to go ahead and funnel that out.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.500
 Now the final really cool scrape we can do with this target list.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.000
 That's a strategy that I think is super, super underutilized.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 If I come to the settings here and look at my top performers, we can look here and say when my organic rank is between positions one and 10 and the search volume is greater than 100.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.200
 I want to pull that list.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.400
 Well, why would I want to pull that list?

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.100
 First of all, it's good to understand where you're winning and what the search volume is of those keywords that you're winning.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:09.200
 But another thing that I think is really important, especially if you're even in the top five, if you wanted to customize this filter for top five, you could do that, is you may actually want to stop running paper click ads.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:17.200
 Like, hey, if you're already top of SERP, you're already in that top row, do you really need to spend as much money on paper click terms for that particular keyword?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.900
 It's definitely worth testing pausing those campaigns.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.700
 Once you reach that higher organic rank, track it and see if you even needed to be spending money on paper click.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.000
 Oftentimes you can save a whack load of money by doing that.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.900
 So if you came here again to this and you just went down here to the my top performers, you can pull that data there.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.300
 So I think you can start to imagine how powerful this tool is, right?

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.700
 It's got whack loads, seven different data sources that you can integrate into this.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.800
 Takes a little bit of time to set up.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:48.600
 But once it's set up, you can refresh this daily, weekly, monthly using new source data files that you just drop into Google Drive, rerun the script and you're off to the races.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.100
 You can in real time optimize your listing.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.899
 You can look at other competitors listings.

00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:59.800
 You can look at other competitors performance and really hone in on the keywords and the priority of those keywords that matter to you and your business.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 You can cross reference it with Amazon data.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.300
 You can look at paper click data.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.100
 You can pull customized feeds.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.699
 The possibilities are really endless.

00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:10.300
 And I think the best thing I like about this is it's in Google Sheets.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.500
 You know, there's Helium 10 software where you can optimize listings.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.600
 Zonguru has it.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.300
 There's other software out there where it's within an actual software platform.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.899
 But guess what? It's hard to save.

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:20.700
 It's hard to edit.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.399
 It's hard to share with your team.

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:25.700
 It's hard to have a track history of different files over time.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.600
 So I think having all of this data pulled in-house into Google Sheets is a truly powerful advantage.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.700
 So again, if you want access to this tool, I've got links down below.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.899
 Be sure to say hi to Brett in the comments.

00:27:35.899 --> 00:27:42.899
 He's a certified badass and a total weapon and owe a lot of his effort on making this thing happening, bringing ideas to life.

00:27:42.899 --> 00:27:43.800
 So cheers to you, Brett.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.600
 And if you like this and want to understand more about the listing stuff,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.300
 I'm going to do a separate listing masterclass update that's going to use this data.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.800
 And we're going to show how we can actually build out a badass listing.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.399
 So what did you think of that?

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:56.100
 Hit me in the comments to let me know what you think.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.199
 But I hope that the strategy and this tool helps take your Amazon business to the next level.

00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:05.000
 Because if you harness the power of this stuff, it absolutely can.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.100
 Again, if you want access to that tool, check the link down below.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.800
 You've got a special heist discount.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.500
 I don't get any commission off this.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:18.600
 It's just a kudos to Brett for helping harness ideas and implementing them into really a world class Google Sheets automation.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.200
 And if you want this tool free for a year,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.800
 I've also got a link down below to my course,

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:30.400
 the FBA Blueprint where all pro signups get one year free of this tool and all core signups get six months free.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.900
 And as features get added, as new tutorials, as new processes get integrated,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.800
 I'm also going to leave links down below and keep those up to date.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.800

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:50.200
 As always, thanks for tuning in, guys.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.500
 Love you. Appreciate you.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:29:11.900
 Thanks for stopping by. Cheers.
